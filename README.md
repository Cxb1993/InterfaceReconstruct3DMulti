Reconstruction from Volume of Fluid Data, from Thesis (2013)

Originally compiled using Microsoft Visual Studio, but not using heavy dependencies, so it should be fairly portable.

The inputs are generally procedurally generated (various test cases such as sphere data, or intersecting solids, or triple/quadruple points), and the output are Paraview files that describe the solids at each iteration of the algorithm.
